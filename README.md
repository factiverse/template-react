# CheckIt

The CheckIt Editor supports you in the writing of news articles or other factual texts. Claims can be found automatically within the text and checked for their support with the help of an AI by [Factiverse](https://www.factiverse.no/). All sources found online that support or contradict the claim are displayed and make it transparent how the AI came to its conclusion.
